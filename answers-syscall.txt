1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called `syscall`?
`usertrap()`

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent?
a7 = 0x7. The value of a7 is the number used for system call, and in this question, 7 stands for SYS_exec.

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
Since SPP was set to 0, we know that the CPU was in user mode.

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
`lw  a3, 0(zero)`
register a3 corresponds to the variable num.

5. Why does the kernel crash?
scause = 13 means the kernel crash because the kernel detect a load page fault.
This is reasonable because we try to get an integer store at address 0, which is not mapped in the kernel address space.

6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id(pid)?
Its name is `initcode`, and its pid is 1.
